Analysis code for understanding the potential for harvested forests to
contribute to supporting health bee populations from the publication:
"Beyond timber: forest management can support healthy bee populations"
(doi:)

The data accompanies the code for reproducibility, but we ask to be
contacted (lponisio@gmail.com and Jim.Rivers@oregonstate.edu) if
authors wish to use the data for a publication.

The R scripts in analysis should be run in order (i.e., 0, 1, 2) to
reproduce the analyses and figures.  All of the packages needed to run
the analyses are listed in the packages.sh file in the main
directory. All analyses were run using R (version 4.2.2).
