Analysis code for understanding the potential for harvested forests to
contribute to supporting healthy bee populations from the publication:
"Host and floral communities shape parasite prevalence and
reproduction in intensively managed conifer forests" published in
Ecosphere.

The data accompanies the code for reproducibility, but we ask to be
contacted (lponisio@gmail.com and Jim.Rivers@oregonstate.edu) if
authors wish to use the data for a publication.

The R scripts in the analysis folder should be run in order (i.e., 0,
1, 2) to reproduce the analyses and figures.  All of the packages
needed to run the analyses are listed in the 0packages.sh file in the
main directory. All analyses were run using R (version 4.3.1). The
dataPrep code is included for transparency, though all of the prepped
data is in the data folder.
